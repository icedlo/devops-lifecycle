# DevOps Lifecycle

## Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that bridges the gap between software development and IT operations. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement to deliver high-quality software rapidly and reliably. At its core, DevOps fosters a culture of shared responsibility, transparency, and alignment between development and operations teams.

### Core Principles of DevOps

- **Collaboration:** Breaking down silos between teams to promote communication and cooperation.
- **Automation:** Streamlining repetitive tasks to accelerate workflows and reduce errors.
- **Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD):** Frequent code integration, automated testing, and seamless deployment.
- **Monitoring and Feedback:** Real-time insights to inform improvements and ensure system health.

## DevOps Lifecycle Stages

1. **Planning**  
   Identify project goals, define requirements, and align teams on deliverables and timelines.

2. **Development**  
   Write and manage source code with version control, following coding standards and best practices.

3. **Building**  
   Compile code into executable artifacts, managing dependencies and configurations.

4. **Testing**  
   Automatically and manually validate code to detect bugs and ensure functionality.

5. **Release**  
   Prepare and approve the build for deployment, ensuring compliance and readiness.

6. **Deployment**  
   Deploy the application into staging or production environments using automated tools.

7. **Operations**  
   Manage infrastructure and environments to ensure performance, scalability, and availability.

8. **Monitoring**  
   Continuously track application and infrastructure performance, gathering metrics for improvement.
